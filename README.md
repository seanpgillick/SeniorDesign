# SeniorDesign Project: Crime Analysis

# About our project
The main goal of our Crime Analysis project is to provide our users with unparalleled information regarding all reported crimes in major cities across the United States. Utilizing tools such as the Open Data Network API, as well as downloadable CSVs provided by the cities, we are able to collect and standardize all crime data. Once standardized, we convert the data into easy to read visualizations which aim to help users understand and contextualize the major crime types and locations of those crimes. Our hope is that from using our site, the general public, along with law enforcement agencies, will be able to get an extra level of insight into crime trends to help make better informed decisions when considering a new place to live or visit.

# About us
We are a team of six students (Sean Gillick, Grant Fecteau, Michael Donahue, Darius Grosch, Joshua Jacob, and Suyash Rane) who are working towards our undergraduate degrees in the College of Computing and Informatics at Drexel University. We worked alongside our advisor, Milad Toutounchian, who helped guide us through the project planning, creation, and refinement phases over the course of our senior year. Our team also received help polishing our frontend UI from Kartik Vora, a graduate student at Drexel University.

### Virtual Environment:

Before getting started make sure you are in Dev branch or pull latest changes from Dev branch. Currently Dev branch is updated.

We are using a python venv virtual environment. This was created using 'py -m pip install --user virtualenv'
The dependencies that are installed in our vm can be found in requirements.txt

To activate the virtual environment run the following command while in the main directory:
./env/Scripts/activate

To deactivate the virtual environment run:
deactivate

To update/install the dependenices in vm, first activate the vm, then run the following commands:
py -m pip install --upgrade pip
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

To ensure all scripts are ran with the correct dependencies and the correct versions, they should be ran within the vm

# Demo
To launch a local version run, make sure you are in the top level of the directory. Next run: 
python application.py

Next open:
http://localhost:2000
